# Time to File
Writes the current time in 00:00 format to `text.txt` in this directory. The txt file is generated after the program runs for the first time.

I'm Dylan Landry, I made this! Follow my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/dylan_landry); I live stream programming there!

## How to Use
1. Go to [this project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyllandry/time-to-file).
1. Click "Clone or Download" and then "Download Zip"
1. Unzip the file.
   - *If you are unfamiliar with navigating your computer via a terminal or command prompt, then unzip the file in a familiar directory. You'll later have to navigate to that directory via a terminal or command prompt.*
1. Install Node from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Use your terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows) to navigate to this directory.
    - *You can use `cd` (change directory) to change directory.*
    - *You can use `ls` (list on MacOS) or `dir` (directory on Windows) to view the current directory's contents.*
1. Once in this directory, enter `npm start` to begin this program.
    - *Npm stands for node package manager. It comes with Node and let's you run node programs.*
    - *You must leave this program running in your terminal or command prompt for the txt file to continually update.*
